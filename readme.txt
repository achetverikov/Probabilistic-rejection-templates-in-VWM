The files bimodal\_two\_target\_search.csv and bimodal\_single\_target\_search.csv contain data accompanying the paper "Probabilistic rejection templates in visual working memory" by Andrey Chetverikov, Gianluca Campana, & √Årni Kristjansson. "R_scripts" folder contains the analyses for the statistics and plots in the paper.

In this experiment we investigated whether observers can keep in their visual working memory templates based on two ignored stimuli sets simultaneously.
